How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Didn't have to spend time comparing parts of the files that were the same.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can spend less time narrowing down when a bug was introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Might forget to save if manual.  Not meaningful or compilable if autosaved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Different purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log is used to get the history of changes with a description of each change, and git diff is used to compare what actually was added or deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing that you can always go backwards makes you less afraid to break something

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
