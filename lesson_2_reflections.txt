What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates the .git directory.  It is necessary so that you can do the first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is the files selected to be a part of the next commit.  The value it that you can have files that are related to the project but not necessarily intended to be a part of the actual final code.
