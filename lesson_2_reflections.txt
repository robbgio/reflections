What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates the .git directory.  It is necessary so that you can do the first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is the files selected to be a part of the next commit.  The value it that you can have files that are related to the project but not necessarily intended to be a part of the actual final code.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By comparing the staging area with the most recent commit you can verify that only one logical change was made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Trying experiments where you want to see how it plays out after a number of changes.  To make different versions of the same game for different audiences or to test to see which version people like.
